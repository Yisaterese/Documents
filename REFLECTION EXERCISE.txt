           REFLECTION EXERCISE


1. Before i came to semicolon,  i never knew what curly braces where meant for except me seeing it in some maths questions and had never owned or typed on a computer before but now the story is different even though am still learning but i still count it as growth to me.
 
2. I think my biggest challenge last year was me having to leave my job and come to semicolon when i have no one to call on to when i need money and again sitting in a  class to learn after some years of not doing anything mentally challenging but just the hustle and buzzle in lagos. in terms of learning, i have been trying to adapt over time and its working but it's not easy at all.

3. if i knew, i would have read the textbook that was given to me over and over before coming to semicolon probably things would have made more sense at this level.
I'am learnig the hard way from my mistake through the struggle of trying to understand the concepts as something new.

4. Yes engaging with teachers and friends has supported my growth.
I remember when we started chapter 3 i could not undertand anything the facilitator was talking about,everything sounded gibberish. miss Jennifer spoke about "setters and getters" that very day and i was totally lost, after classes she sat me down with  others and made me do "setters and getters " over and over again and now i know better.

5.I would like to further develop the following skills...
	-- Discipline towards my reading habbit and time management.
	-- Improve in my communicative skills.
	-- Learn how to associate with people that can impact me positively and more as time goes on.

6. I would be more accountable to myself.
	-- Probably read and practice more.

7. Mentoring,peer acountability.

8. I want to start practicing more.
	-- celebrate my little wins.
	-- i want to stop comparing myself with others because its stealing my moments of happines.
